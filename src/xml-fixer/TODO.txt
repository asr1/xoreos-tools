handle parameters (h, --help, at leat)

Also restyle to fit xoreos standard.

Also clean up commented code, etc.
(working effort, should be mostly better).

Remove unused functions.
(should be mostly gone?)


see if can replace countoccurances with std::count

Maybe we can leverage inparen with the comma thing? Are those even in the same method? 
I think inparen is presently only in the, uh, innerquote file, but let's see if we can't reimplement it
or if that would even help? I think the DMC issue is also in a paren. Hmmm.
