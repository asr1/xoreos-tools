handle parameters (h, --help, at leat)

Also restyle to fit xoreos standard.

Also clean up commented code, etc.
(working effort, should be mostly better).

Remove unused functions.
(should be mostly gone?)


see if can replace countoccurances with std::count

Maybe we can leverage inparen with the comma thing? Are those even in the same method? 
I think inparen is presently only in the, uh, innerquote file, but let's see if we can't reimplement it
or if that would even help? I think the DMC issue is also in a paren. Hmmm.



We need to convert everything to be using UString.
I believe, if I remember correctly, that we were having trouble getting it to run from within the Aurora namespace.

There's a whole list of dependencies, and frankly, I'm not sure which version is more up-to-date--The xoreos version, or the xoreos-tools version.

Whichever version it is, I recommend we adapt the code to work with Ustring, THEN worry about adapting to the namespace.



Edit: it looks like the xoreos/src/aurora version is the most current.

Wouldn't hurt to compare our code to Charlie's to see what she did. It soudned like she just fixed the node issue,


Next time we have internet, we can commit with the comment of cleaning up documentation, as we mostly just updated comments.
Also updated brackets to conform to xoreos standards.
