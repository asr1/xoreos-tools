handle parameters (h, --help, at leat)


Remove unused functions.
(should be mostly gone?)

see if can replace countoccurances with std::count

Maybe we can leverage inparen with the comma thing? Are those even in the same method? 
I think inparen is presently only in the, uh, innerquote file, but let's see if we can't reimplement it
or if that would even help? I think the DMC issue is also in a paren. Hmmm.

Copyright doesn't need to run on every line.

We need to convert everything to use UString.
Need to change code to use iterators instead of loops

It looks like the xoreos-tools/src/aurora version is the most current.

Wouldn't hurt to compare our code to Charlie's to see what she did. It soudned like she just fixed the node issue,
but there may be more too it.



TODO: Need Common::UString.at, Common::UString.insert //IGNORE

No we have an insert.	void insert(iterator pos, uint32 c);
Use getposition(size_t) to get the iterator pos.

We should be able to use getPosition(size_t) and then dereference the result to simulate AT
